# Inception:
* This project was created using Code Institute template from GitHub:
* Project was created and called : Lax-Bath
* In order to push this project from GitPod to Github I used a set of git commands on the terminal:
*	git status - Check the status of the repository and see if there were any changes in files
*	git add . - Add the files that were modified/created, so we can commit it
*	git commit -m "message for commit" - Commits all the changes
*	git push - Pushes all committed versions to GitHub

# Deployment on GitHub Pages:
*	The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:
*	Log in to GitHub and locate GitHub Repository
*	At the top of repository click on "Settings"
*	Once you are in settings scroll down to "GitHub Pages"
*	Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
*	After the page automatically refresh scroll down again on "GitHub Pages" and I will see live link to the published site.

# Cloning Repository:
*	Local Clone
*	Log in to GitHub and locate GitHub Repository
*	At the top of repository click on Code
*	From the dropdown menu under HTTPS copy the link
*	Now on the IDE create a directory where you want to make the clone
*	Type git clone and paste the link that you copy from step 3.

# Forking repository:
* By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting  the original repository by using the following steps:
*	Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
*	At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on - - the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
*	You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
